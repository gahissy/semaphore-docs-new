You can easily use [git-deploy](https://github.com/mislav/git-deploy) or just
plain git with [custom
hooks](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to deploy your
application from Semaphore. This document explains how to configure that
process.

### Step 1: Generate a new SSH key

First, generate a new, passwordless SSH key pair. Add the public SSH key to your
server, by copying its content to your server's user `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

The content of a public SSH key is typically located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or
`~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub` on your development machine.

The private SSH key will be added to Semaphore later.

### Step 2: Create a new deploy server on Semaphore

To get started, find your desired project and follow "Set Up Deployment" link
under list of the branches.

When asked about the deployment method, choose the "Generic" option.

After that, select either Automatic or Manual deployment strategy. See
[understanding automatic and manual deployment on
Semaphore](/docs/understanding-automatic-and-manual-deployment.html) if you are
not sure which option would work best for you.

### Step 3: Write your deploy commands

We recommend that you read about the [sequence of steps Semaphore executes
before your deploy commands](/docs/deploy-sequence.html).

In order for our git-deploy deployment to work, we need to do the following.

- Gather the public SSH host keys of your server(s) to avoid an authorization
prompt during deploy.
- Add a git remote to where you are about to push your code on the server.
- Push to the branch that is currently checked out in to remote.

This translates into the following deploy commands (adapt to your values):

```bash
ssh-keyscan -H -p 22 yourserver.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
git remote add production "user@yourserver.com:/apps/myapp/current" || true
git push --force production $BRANCH_NAME:master
```

Some users have reported that running `git remote rm production || true` before
`git remote add ...` helps solve problems that might occur if you change the
value of remote, since Semaphore is [caching your git repository between builds
and deploys](/docs/caching-between-builds.html).

### Step 4: Paste your private SSH key on Semaphore

On the next screen, simply paste the private SSH key that you generated earlier
in Step 1.

### Step 5: Name your server

In this step you need to provide a name for your server, which can be any name
you like. It will be used on your Semaphore dashboard and deployment timeline.
During this step, you may also choose to set a server URL for quick access to
wherever you are deploying your application.

The final screen will show you an overview of what you've configured.

You are now ready to finish up the process and start deploying.
